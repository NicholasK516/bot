# Tailosive

The offical tailosive discord moderation bot.

## Setup

- Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` in source then fill in the config details.
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in root of the project then fill in the .env details.

The prefered package manager is yarn but npm can be used. To install simply run:

```zsh
yarn install
```

To run the project in development:

```zsh
yarn dev
```

To run the project in production:

```zsh
yarn build
yarn start
```

**We recommand you use something like pm2 so the bot automatically restarts.**
